# Module 6 Documentation

## Train a multi-class classification model on AutoML

### Tutorial to follow https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/beginner/beginners-guide
### Vertex AI Workbench is the single environment for data scientists to complete all of their ML work, from experimentation, to deployment, to managing and monitoring models. 

1. Vertex AI is the name of Google's AutoML.
2. For Image multi-class classification, we will download the MNIST digits dataset with the .jpg images
3. In the Vertix AI, upload sample images of each number (at least 10 samples for each class)
4. Label each image the appropriate number
5. Limit the training to 1-4 hours using default settings (this may take a while)
6. In the Vertex AI Interface, click on validation
7. Upload a test image of a number.
8. The result will output a percentage of classification
